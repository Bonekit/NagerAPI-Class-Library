<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After Nager discontinued the free use of the NuGet package for accessing public holidays, I developed a service class for the Nager API.
I'm very thankfull that we can use the API for free!

With my service class you can use the following features:
* Get public holidays for the year and country
* Check if today is a public holiday
* Get the upcoming public holidays of the next 365 days
* Filter by days off in your country
* Read the content from the response object as JSON-String

### Built With

* [Nager-API](https://date.nager.at/Api)
